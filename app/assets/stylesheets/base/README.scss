Read this file to understand the structure of the css for this application.

Layout is designed using flexbox. Overall structure is built using a simple flexbox model. The body tag centeres the content using flex(column). The sidebar and the page content container are split into two columns by using flex(row) on page-container. The max width for page content is 1200 pixels. If the display width exceeds the max-width, the content will remain centered. The page content container uses flex(column) to seperate the page content from the footer.

- Use specific selectors over hard coded class names.
- Colors and stylistic effects are applied as a theme, never to specific elements.
